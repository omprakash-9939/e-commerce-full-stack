## Task - Integrate Open AI (LLM) 

## R&D Plan: LLM based Admin Communication with MongoDB

## Objective - Enable an admin to interact with MongoDB using natural language queries.
Instead of writing complex MongoDB queries, the admin can type or speak commands, and the system converts them into actionable queries.

## Process --> IOP(based on that standard only)

## Motivation -Traditional admin panels require knowledge of database schema and queries.

Using LLM + NLP, we make data interaction intuitive and conversational.

This approach can be first of its kind: combining AI reasoning with a custom-trained NLP model for your database.

Architecture Overview

[Admin UI]  
      │
      └── [Express API / aiRoutes.js]  
                │
                ├── [aiController.js]  
                │         │
                │         ├── [llmService.js (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)]  --- Stop  
                │         │
                │         ├── [nlpManager.js (Custom NLP)]  --- Continue  
                │         │
                │         └── [validateFilter.js] --> [MongoDB Query]  


Flow:
Admin sends a message via frontend (chat or input box).

aiController.js receives the message.

The message is preprocessed by nlpManager.js.

The processed message is sent to llmService.js for reasoning using GPT-4o-mini.

GPT output is validated in validateFilter.js.

MongoDB executes the validated query.

Response sent back to the admin.

4. Implementation Plan
Step 1: Setup OpenAI

Create OpenAI Account

Generate API Key

Add key to .env:

Step 2: AI Controller

aiController.js

Step 3: Routes

aiRoutes.js

Step 4: LLM Service

llmService.js

Step 5: NLP Manager

nlpManager.js


Step 6: Validation

validateFilter.js


Step 7: Server Integration

server.js


5 . Admin UI Concept

Input Box: Admin types or speaks commands.

Chat Interface: Display AI responses.

Command Suggestions: Optional auto-suggest for common queries.

Response Cards: Show MongoDB results in tables or lists.


## Let ' s move on implementing and integration part.

## Prerequisites 
1. Create account on chatGpt for API key
   - a) Generate API key
   - b) Add API key in your .env file
2. Create aiCobtroller.js file 
    - Here we will write logic to communicate with our db.
3.  create aiRoutes.js 
    -  Defined API address and commuicate with controller function.
4. Create folder (service) and inside this folder create file like llmSearvice.js 
     - Where we will connect to open AI  model: "gpt-4o-mini", 
5. Create utils folder and inside that create two seperate file like nlpManager.js and validateFilter.js 
     - nlpManager - This is my lovely own train model (Increase the resoning level of your model here only) 

     -  validateFilter.js - Perform validation task here
 6. server.js (call your api , app.use("/api", aiRoutes);)       

## -------------------------- Custome module ------------------------- ##

## Approch 2 
1. Design Custome module.
2. Custome module - NPL (Natural Language Processing)
node-nlp: This comprehensive library provides tools for building chatbots and performing various NLP tasks, including intent recognition, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis. It supports multiple languages and allows for training custom models.


### Project Setup Plan

1. Install dependencies (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-nlp)
Install node-nlp and other required packages.
npm install node-nlp express mongoose cors dotenv

2. Database Connection
Configure a database connection (e.g., MongoDB) in a central file.

server.js → Initialize Express, load middleware, and connect to the database.

3. API Design & Layered Structure

Routes (aiRoutes.js):
Define REST endpoints for AI-related operations.

Controller (aiController.js):
Handle request/response logic, interact with services and models.
Connect both User and Collection models as required.

NLP Manager (nlpManager.js):
Encapsulate all NLP-related logic.

Training

Model persistence (save/load)

Intent recognition
